# Fractal Unification Theory Simulations
This repository hosts open-source simulation models for the Fractal Unification Theory (FUT), validating predictions for redshift, CMB, fifth force, and FTL travel as described in [Fractal Unification Theory, 2025]. 

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fut-sim`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run example: `python examples/example_redshift.py`
